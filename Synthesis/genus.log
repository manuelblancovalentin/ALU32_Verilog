  Message Summary for Library NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib:

  Could not find an attribute in the library. [LBR-436]: 147
  An unsupported construct was detected in this library. [LBR-40]: 1

Info    : Created nominal operating condition. [LBR-412]
        : Operating condition '_nominal_' was created for the PVT values (1.000000, 1.100000, 25.000000) in library 'NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib'.
        : The nominal operating condition is represented, either by the nominal PVT values specified in the library source (via nom_process,nom_voltage and nom_temperature respectively), or by the default PVT values (1.0,1.0,1.0).
Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'ANTENNA_X1' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

|          |        |      | message is issued. If you encounter any lib cells |
|          |        |      | having output pins without max_fanout attribute,  |
|          |        |      | then you can specify their attribute using        |
|          |        |      | 'set_max_fanout' command.                         |
| LBR-76   |Warning |   24 |Detected both combinational and sequential timing  |
|          |        |      | arcs in a library cell. This might prevent the    |
|          |        |      | tool from using this cell for technology mapping. |
|          |        |      | The tool will treat it as unusable.               |
|          |        |      |The library cell will be treated as a              |
|          |        |      | timing-model. Make sure that the timing arcs and  |
|          |        |      | output function are defined correctly. Even if    |
|          |        |      | the cell intends to have dual-functionality, it   |
|          |        |      | cannot be unmapped or automatically inferred.     |
| LBR-81   |Warning |   33 |Non-monotonic wireload model found.                |
|          |        |      |Non-monotonic wireload models can cause problems   |
|          |        |      | during synthesis and/or mapping.  Raising some of |
|          |        |      | the points in the curve to give it a monotonic    |
|          |        |      | shape.                                            |
| LBR-9    |Warning |   14 |Library cell has no output pins defined.           |
|          |        |      |Add the missing output pin(s)                      |
|          |        |      | , then reload the library. Else the library cell  |
|          |        |      | will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable.     |
|          |        |      | Timing_model means that the cell does not have    |
|          |        |      | any defined function. If there is no output pin,  |
|          |        |      | Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the |
|          |        |      | attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on   |
|          |        |      | the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for  |
|          |        |      | mapping and it will not be picked up from the     |
|          |        |      | library for synthesis. If you query the attribute |
|          |        |      | 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: |
|          |        |      | 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The       |
|          |        |      | message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and    |
|          |        |      | not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend  |
|          |        |      | upon the output function defined in the pin group |
|          |        |      | (output pin)                                      |
|          |        |      | of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin    |
|          |        |      | will not have any function defined.               |
